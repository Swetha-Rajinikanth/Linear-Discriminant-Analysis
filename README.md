# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis

Data source: https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/datasets/SAheart.info.txt

Data Pre-processing and Analysis: Jupyter Notebook

My objective was to perform Linear Discriminant analysis for the dataset to construct a model on the basis of presence of coronary heart disease for an individual and examine the accuracy of the model.

I thereby split the dataset into training and test sets, trained the model using the training set and evaluated its performance on test set.

I examined the accuracy of the model through confusion matrix. I got an accuracy of 0.80.
